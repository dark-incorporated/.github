# Research

The *because* behind a design: the papers, the measurements, the alternatives that were rejected. Deliberately separate from [`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`../STYLE.md`](../STYLE.md), which state what we do — a reader who wants the decision, not the argument, only has to read those.

## What belongs here

| Kind | An example of the question it settles |
|---|---|
| **A cited source** | a paper that changes a rule: the README rules in [`DOCUMENTATION.md`](../../DOCUMENTATION.md) each name the study behind them |
| **A measurement** | "150 test binaries took 61 minutes; one took 132 seconds" — and the commands that produced both numbers |
| **A decision record** | the options, what each cost, which was chosen, and what would make us revisit it |
| **A post-mortem** | what went wrong, the evidence, and the rule that prevents it |

A document here that ends without a decision is a note, not research — say so at the top, and say when it will be decided.

## The shape of a research document

1. **The question**, in one sentence.
2. **What is measured and what is reasoned**, kept apart. Numbers name their source: a command, a test, a bench, a citation. A claim that was not measured says so.
3. **The alternatives**, and what each would cost.
4. **The decision**, or an explicit "undecided" with the date it is needed by.
5. **The date and the commit** it was written at, so a later reader knows what it was true of.

## Naming

`<date>-<topic>.md`, e.g. `2026-11-02-engine-free-crate-names.md`. A topic that is revisited gets a new file with a new date that links the old one — the old file is not rewritten, because a record of what was believed is the thing worth keeping.

## Papers already relied on

These are cited by [`DOCUMENTATION.md`](../../DOCUMENTATION.md), and a new claim about how people read or trust a repository should extend that list rather than repeat it:

## Queued, not started

Questions someone has asked for and nobody has begun. Moving one out of here means writing its document and linking it above.

- **Can the crates' public APIs be made more standard, so they work well together?** Queued 2026-11-02 by the owner; not started, and deliberately not begun while the project-command trust work (`bevy_grimoire`, branch `security/project-command-trust`) is in flight.
  - **What it would cover:** across the 14 crates, the plugin and system-set names, the settings types and their `serde` features, error types and refusal wording, how a seed is passed, feature-flag names, what each re-exports (the style guide says flat re-exports and no prelude), and how each is exposed to the editor and to an agent.
  - **Why it matters:** the Cauldron configures each crate through that crate's own serde settings, and a Python or other script layer, if one is ever built, would expose the same types (see [`2026-11-02-python-scripting.md`](2026-11-02-python-scripting.md) once it is merged). Inconsistent APIs mean per-crate special cases in both.
  - **First step when it starts:** an inventory table generated from each crate's `lib.rs` and `Cargo.toml` (measured, with the command), then prior art (the Rust API Guidelines and Bevy's own plugin conventions), then a proposal as a decision record. Breaking a published crate's API is a cost to name, as with the engine-free naming question below.

## Already open, and needing a document here

Two questions the family currently answers by living with an inconsistency. Each deserves a file:

- **Do engine-free crates keep the `bevy_` prefix?** Four crates say yes (`bevy_grimoire_rng`, `_solver`, `_snip`, `bevy_oracle`), `isomesh` says no. Renaming is a breaking change to published crates and to `bevy_society`'s dependency.
- **Which `bevy_devshot` is the real one?** The workspace copy is unpublished and the standalone repository exists; crates.io reserves the name once.
